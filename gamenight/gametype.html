            Do you want to have fun but don't necessarily want to do as much as
            the other people in your group? If so, improv games are the games
            for you. Improv games are games that are generally played by actors
            to help them come up with random things to do and say on the spot.
            However, you don't need to be an actor to play the games or to enjoy
            watching others play. Most of these games are best played when there
            are at least four people playing the game and another group of at
            least 3 people watching. Good examples of these games include but
            are not limited to:
            <a href="gamerule.html" title="Game Rules">Lie Detector</a>,
            <a href="gamerule.html" title="Game Rules">Freeze Frame</a>,
            <a href="gamerule.html" title="Game Rules">Late Again</a>,
